            <p style="color:white;">Inspired by Beeple's <a href="http://beeple-crap.com/everydays.php">Everydays</a> project, I plan to complete some piece of work — an image, a sound, a video, or some combination of these — every day. The aim of this project is to get better at certain skills, and to make myself practice regularly.</p>
            <p style="color:white;">Of course, sometimes life will get in the way and I will miss days, although I will try to catch up on the days I miss.</p>
